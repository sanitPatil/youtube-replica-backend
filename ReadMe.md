# VideoTube Backend ~ YouTube Replica Backend

## Description

**VideoTube Backend** is a backend system built to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube. This application allows users to **upload**, and **interact** with video content through a comprehensive **REST API**. The system provides essential features for a video-sharing platform, including **user authentication**, **video uploads**, **likes**, **dislikes**, **comments**, **subscriptions**, and **playlist creation**.

The project leverages **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for backend development, along with **Cloudinary** for storing videos and images in cloud storage. It also includes robust user authentication and security using **JWT** **(JSON Web Tokens)**. The system is designed to be **scalable**, **efficient**, and **flexible**, making it an ideal foundation for any video-based application.

This project is developed to showcase my expertise in **creating**, **debugging**, and **building large-scale applications**. _It highlights my ability to design and develop scalable, high-performance backend systems using JavaScript and Node.js_.

Future enhancements include support for real-time video streaming, live chats, video recommendations, and search functionality.
